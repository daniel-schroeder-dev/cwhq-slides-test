In the last lesson, you learned how to manipulate the filesystem using Python.

You learned how to create paths and directories from a Python program.

You also learned how to prevent users from hacking our apps using **Path Traversal** attacks.

__INSTRUCTOR NOTES__: - What did we use to manipulate the filesystem with Python?
- How do we create paths? How do we create directories?
- What is a **Path Traversal** attack? How do we defend against it?

__DESIGN NOTES__: 

__INSTRUCTOR NOTES__: The kids don't have sub-folders for each homework assignment, that's just in the instructor folder.

- Display everyone's homework assignment from the last class. Look at the code of at least one student's project to show how everything fits together. If anyone's project is not working, do an in-class code review and let the other students participate in helping fix any issues but don't take too much time debugging; that's what Homework Help and the Forum are for. If anyone did the bonus assignments or something extra, highlight their work here.
